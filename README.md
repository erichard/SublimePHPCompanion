# Sublime PHP Companion [![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=dhalsimfr&url=https://github.com/erichard/SublimePHPCompanion&title=SublimePHPCompanion&language=&tags=github&category=software) 

This Sublime Text 3 Package provides cool stuff for PHP 5.3+ coding session. 

## Successor of SublimeCTagsPHP

This plugin is the successor of [SublimeCTagsPHP](https://github.com/erichard/SublimeCTagsPHP). PHP Companion use the built-in index of Sublime Text 3 instead of CTags.

**Warning!** PHP Companion does not work on Sublime Text 2 and never will.

## Installation

### Package control

Just search for PHP Companion in package control and you're ready.

### Git clone
Clone this repo in your Sublime Text 3 Package dir.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/erichard/SublimePHPCompanion "PHP Companion"
```

## Commands

### find_use

Just bring your cursor hover a class name, hit the `F5` key (default but customizable) and that's it.

It will show you the different namespace that match your class, pick up one and your done.

PHP Companion will sort your uses statement in alphabetical order.

### expand_fqcn

This command expand the class under the cursor to its FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name).
You have two keys for this command `F6` and `shift+F6` that respectively expand 
without and with the leading namespace separator `\`.

### import_namespace

Just hit the `F4` key, it will add the namespace definition based on the absolute
filename of the current file. I use a simple trick to determine where the
namespace begun, actually the namespace will start at the first CamelCased
folder.

If a namespace is already declared, the command will shout how crazy you are in
the status bar.

**Warning:** This feature require a filename so the command won't work in an unsaved buffer.

### goto_definition_scope

Hit `shift+F12` to search for a method definition based on the current scope. It will fallback to
the "goto_definition" command if a match was not found.

## Settings

### exclude_dir

List of directories to exclude when searching for the class declaration file.
Path are relative to the project directory. 

Please note that the filtering is done after the search in the index. So this option has no impact on performance, 
it's just a convenient way to avoid duplicate namespace declaration in some case.

### start_dir_pattern

The pattern used to guess the namespace in the `import_namespace` command.
The default pattern should work for most uses cases but you can change it if
your projects are stored in different way.
